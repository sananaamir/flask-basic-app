# A Basic Flask App Deployed To Heroku

This repository started as a basic Flask API app first, but quickly transformed into a research & learning project for me. So far I've bootstrapped ReactJS into it using various examples I've seen online. 

The bootsrapping in this project is not perfect; however, this project has enabled me to quickly figure out what the right way of creating a full stack web application setup looks like. Pretty soon I'll start another project where I'll incorporate my lessons learned during the development of this project to create a boilerplate template following best practices.

I do want to clarify that regardless of the approach used to bootstrap the app, this app is still a fully working Heroku deployed app. Below you'll find information regarding the endpoints/urls.

## App URL/Endpoint Info:
- App Base URL:  ```https://sa-flask-basic-app.herokuapp.com/```

- Hello World API Endpoint: ```https://<base_url>/api/hello-world```

- SQLite Users Endpoint: ```https://<base_url>/api/users```
